# Packer leftover cleanup. Shared copy - keep in sync with lib-main-infra/.github/scripts/packer-cleanup.sh.
#
# Packer's azure-arm builder always creates an intermediate managed image on the
# way to a gallery version, plus a build VM and its network kit. None of it is
# cleaned up by anything else, so it grows forever (~17 scratch images/month). A
# cancelled build is not hypothetical: build-on-dispatch.yml runs with
# cancel-in-progress: true, and a cancelled base build once left a D2s_v5 running
# for 50 days.
#
# Where the build VM leaks depends on how the project configures Packer, and the
# two shapes need different sweeps:
#   * no build_resource_group_name (lib-main-infra) -> Packer makes a throwaway
#     pkr-* resource group, and a dead build leaks the whole group.
#     -> sweep-build-groups
#   * build_resource_group_name set (mccarthy-infra) -> Packer builds inside an
#     existing RG, and a dead build leaks loose pkrvm/pkrni/pkros resources with
#     no group to find.
#     -> sweep-build-resources
#
# Every sweep deletes only what is older than max_age_hours (default 24). A
# GitHub job is capped at 6 hours, so nothing belonging to a running build can
# ever qualify. Anything lacking a BuildDate tag is reported, never deleted.
#
# Deleting a scratch managed image is safe: the published gallery version keeps
# its own replicated copy, and storageProfile.source.id is provenance only.
#
# Usage:
#   packer-cleanup.sh sweep-build-groups [max_age_hours]
#   packer-cleanup.sh sweep-build-resources <resource-group> [max_age_hours]
#   packer-cleanup.sh sweep-scratch-images <resource-group> [max_age_hours]
#   packer-cleanup.sh delete-scratch-image <resource-group> <image-name>
