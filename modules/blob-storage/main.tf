# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Blob Storage Module
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creates Azure Blob Storage for Drupal media files:
#   - Storage account with configurable replication (LRS/GRS)
#   - Private container for Drupal media
#   - Optional soft delete and versioning
#   - RBAC role assignment for VMSS managed identity
#   - Optional private endpoint for secure access
#
# Integration:
#   Drupal accesses blobs via az_blob_fs module (native Azure Blob PHP SDK).
#   VMSS identity needs Storage Blob Data Contributor role.
