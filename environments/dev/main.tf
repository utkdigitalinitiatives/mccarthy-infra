# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dev Environment — Ephemeral validation VM (CI-driven; do not apply locally)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this stack owns (in <project>-dev-rg):
#   - A single Drupal VM, replaced on every app-repo dev-branch merge
#
# Backing services come from environments/devtest/:
#   - PostgreSQL:     var.devtest_db_host -> the devtest PostgreSQL FQDN
#   - Blob storage:   var.devtest_storage_account -> the devtest storage account
#   - Storage key + hash salt: read from the shared Key Vault (<project>-kv-*)
#
# Lifecycle (fully automated by GitHub Actions — do not run terraform locally):
#   1. Push to the app repo `dev` branch triggers repository_dispatch (drupal-dev-merge)
#   2. build-on-dispatch.yml: Packer builds new image, prod DB synced into
#      devtest PostgreSQL, blob assets synced into devtest storage, then THIS
#      stack is `terraform apply`-ed to deploy the VM with the new image.
#   3. Developer validates the dev VM, then merges dev -> main.
#   4. deploy-on-main-merge.yml: production deploys, then THIS stack is
#      `terraform destroy`-ed.
#
# State key: dev/terraform.tfstate

# Resource group for dev resources.
#
# READ, not created -- same as the production and devtest stacks.
#
# This block used to CREATE the group, inherited from lib-main where that is
# correct: lib-main-github-actions holds Contributor at subscription scope, so
# it can create and destroy resource groups at will. mccarthy's SP deliberately
# does not -- it holds Contributor on five named groups and nothing wider (see
# the Packer entry in docs/TODO.md, which is the same asymmetry in a different
# place). Production and devtest were converted to data sources for that reason;
# dev was missed because it had never been applied. The first apply, on
# 2026-08-10, failed with "a resource with the ID .../mccarthy-dev-rg already
# exists - to be managed via Terraform this resource needs to be imported".
#
# Importing it instead would be worse than leaving it broken. cleanup-dev runs
# an UNTARGETED `terraform destroy` on this stack after every promotion to main,
# so an imported group would be deleted -- and deleting it also deletes the SP's
# Contributor assignment scoped to it, which the SP cannot regrant itself. Dev
# would then be unrecoverable without PIM Owner re-running bootstrap.
#
# Destroy still tears down everything inside the group, which is where the cost
# is; only the empty shell and its role assignment survive. bootstrap creates
# and owns the group.
